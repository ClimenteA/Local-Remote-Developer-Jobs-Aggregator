### List of technologies

- Tech: tech I was curios 
- Frequency: the amound of times found in about 4k remote jobs gathered (2020)

| Tech       | Frequency | 
|------------|-----------| 
| React      | 1854      | 
| Python     | 1217      | 
| Javascript | 976       | 
| Docker     | 833       | 
| Java       | 819       | 
| PHP        | 673       | 
| Angular    | 631       | 
| C#         | 526       | 
| Vue        | 491       | 
| Typescript | 382       | 
| Django     | 221       | 
| Kotlin     | 181       | 
| Golang     | 167       | 
| Flask      | 122       | 
| Firebase   | 80        | 
| Koa        | 28        | 
| Express.js | 25        | 
| Elm        | 18        | 
| Mithril    | 1         | 


Not a surprise React + Typescript and AWS the most demanded tech.
After JS, Python and PHP come very close then the oldies Java and C#. 


*This is just an MVP, but I found it good enough for my needs.*
